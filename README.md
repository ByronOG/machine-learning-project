# machine-learning-project
Final Project for CS 133: Data Visualization at San Jose State University

Given a dataset containing Police Killings in the U.S.A in 2015

Tasked to create a model to predict whether the diceased were armed or not.

The Project is divided into 3 tasks: Data Visualisation, Data Pre-processing, and Machine Learning Applications

# Data Visualisation
Visualised core features and their relationships with each other to understand the data better.

# Data Pre-Processed
Split data into Training and Test Sets. Transformed Numerical and Categorical Attributes through a pipeline.

# Machine Learning Applications
Predicted labels using 10-fold Cross Validations on three Regression Models. 

Fine-tuned the parameters of the most promising model by performing Grid Searches.

Visualised and analysed the final predictions.
